### Working/ Running the Project

> In this tutorial, I am using **Visual Studio Code**

1. Select your **connected device**
    - E.g. Windows, Chrome, Emulator
2. Run **'void main() {...}'** with either:
    1. Default Methods:
        - Ctrl + F5 (Will run the default `main.dart`)
        - Top-left -> `Run` -> `Without Debugging`
    2. For specific project samples
        1. Locate any **'void main() {...}'**
            - Mostly located in main.dart files
        2. Above `void main...`, click `Run | Debug | Profile`

### Working/ Running the Project

> Must have already successfully connected and logged into Firebase

Type the following codes into the project terminal:

1.  `flutter build web`
    -   Build the project within project folder
